# 50.003: Elements of Software Construction Project
## SUTD Spring 2019
A ticket support system for Accenture's users of ACNAPI. Users submit their queries online and are emailed their ticket request ID before the relevant Accenture administrators follow up with them. Using the administrator dashboard, administrators are able to manage the tickets.

### Requirements:
Required files can be pip installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
In using Accenture's APIs, a secret token must be obtained from them. 

### Built with:
- Python 3.6: Flask
- phpMyAdmin: MySQL

### Disclaimer:
This is an academic project which explains potential security loopholes that may be seen in the project. A commercial product would definitely ensure all these loopholes do not exist on the public repository.
